In the show’s final episode, Bernard resigns from Dunder Mifflin and lands a job in his alma mater’s admissions office. “The weird thing is I’m exactly where I want to be – I just got my dream job at Cornell, and I’m still just thinking about my pals. Only now, they’re the ones I made here,” the melancholy Bernard says. “I wish there’s a way to know you’re in the good old days before you’ve actually left them … someone should write a song about that.”
